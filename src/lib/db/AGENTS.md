## Changes that REQUIRE a migration

Any of these breaks file compatibility unless a migration ships with it:

- Editing `migrations/0001_initial.sql` or any other shipped `NNNN_*.sql` file
- Adding, removing, renaming, or retyping a column in any table
- Adding or removing a table
- Changing constraints, indexes, or `PRAGMA user_version` semantics
- Editing bulk-insert column lists in `db-worker-api.ts` (they must match the table schema exactly)
- Editing row-shape Zod schemas in `mappers/**/schema.ts` (they must match the columns)
- Changing the shape of any JSON blob persisted as a string column. Today these are:
  - `controls.data` (controls JSON)
  - `simulation_settings.data`
  - `project.settings`
  - `pumps.curve_points`
  - `patterns.multipliers`
  - `curves.points`
  - `pipes.coords`, `pumps.coords`, `valves.coords`

If your change is in the list, it is a file-format change. Migration required.

## Changes that do NOT require a migration

These are safe — they don't touch the format:

- Refactors that preserve the column set and row shape
- Reorganizing `mappers/**/columns.ts`, `to-rows.ts`, `patches.ts`, `builders.ts` while keeping their outputs identical
- New commands in `commands/` that read/write existing tables in their established shape
- Adding or restructuring tests
- Performance tweaks (chunk sizes, prepared-statement caches, query rewrites that return the same data)

When in doubt, ask. Do not assume.

## Migration procedure

1. Add a new SQL file `migrations/NNNN_short_description.sql` (next sequential number, zero-padded to 4)
2. Append it to the `migrations` array in `migrations/index.ts` — `APP_VERSION` derives from `migrations.length`, so order matters
3. Update the matching Zod schema in `mappers/**/schema.ts`
4. Update the mapping code (`columns.ts`, `to-rows.ts`, `patches.ts`, `builders.ts`) and any column lists in `db-worker-api.ts`
5. **Verify the migrated-open path works**: open a saved file produced by the previous version; `openDb` should return `status: "migrated"` and `fetchProject` should return a coherent model. Add or extend an integration test (see `commands/open.integration.test.ts` for the round-trip template) to lock this in
6. Migrations are forward-only and immutable once shipped. Never edit a previously-shipped `NNNN_*.sql` file. If a shipped migration is wrong, write the next-numbered one to fix it

## Why this is here

The migration runner lives in `db-worker-api.ts:openDb` — it reads `PRAGMA user_version`, runs anything in `migrations/` past that point, and reports `status: "migrated"`. The mechanism is in place; what's missing is a loud, agent-facing reminder that this directory is not like the rest of the codebase. Routine refactor instincts will silently break user data here.
